# Calendly MCP Server - Project Summary

## 🎯 What This Is

A complete, production-ready MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides full access to the Calendly API through Claude. This goes beyond the limited Calendly integration currently available by adding **update** and **delete** operations.

## ✨ Key Features

### What Makes This Special

**Full CRUD Operations:**
- ✅ **Create** - All creation endpoints
- ✅ **Read** - All query and list endpoints  
- ✅ **Update** - Event types, schedules, and settings ⭐
- ✅ **Delete** - Event types, schedules, and webhooks ⭐

⭐ = Features NOT available in the standard Calendly integration

### What You Can Do

**Event Type Management:**
- Update durations, names, and descriptions
- Change conferencing platforms (Zoom ↔ Google Meet ↔ Teams)
- Modify locations and meeting settings
- Delete unwanted event types
- Bulk operations on multiple event types

**Availability Management:**
- Create custom availability schedules
- Update working hours and time blocks
- Block out specific times (e.g., "no meetings Friday afternoons")
- Delete old schedules

**Advanced Features:**
- Webhook management for real-time notifications
- Organization and team management
- Comprehensive event querying and filtering
- Busy time detection
